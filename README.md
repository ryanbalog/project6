## Purpose:
Project File: "You must add the following function to your BinarySearchTree class of the previous
project ([Project5](https://github.com/ryanbalog/project5)):
- inorder : performs an in-order traversal of the tree. Returns either a list or a
generator. Can be recursive or iterative (hint: recursive is easier).
- rebalance_tree : use the method described below to re-balance the current tree
- So that this re-balance method always works, you will have to modify the add()
method so that it WILL NOT add duplicate elements to the tree."

main.py and binarysearchtree.py are my own work. All other files were provided.

## Method:
- Add methods to BST class
- Manipulate BST data via main.py
- Pass all provided unit tests
